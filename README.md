# ANN-with-Momentum
Artificial Neural Networks with Back Propagation &amp; Momentum (No external libraries used)

## Steps
1. Fix all hyperparameters 
    - Learning rate
    - Number of epochs
    - Number of unit in each layer
    - Momentum
1. Initialize and assign random weights and biases
1. For each training example:
  1. Calculate the output of each unit and propogate through the layers (forward)
  1. Calculate the errors (for output and hidden layers)
  1. Find change in weight (loss)
  1. Update Weights
